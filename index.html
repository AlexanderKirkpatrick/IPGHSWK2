    <h3>Projects</h3>
  </div>
  <p>During my time at <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> so far, I have created a few <em>small</em> projects. Please feel free to visit them, and share any thoughts you might have about them!</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      This was the first project we started! It was written using HTML.

    <li>
      The Boring Lecture Project was created to discover the use of classes! It incorparated CSS styling to the HTML. Very unboring!

      The Branching Test Project was created to explore the uses of creating branches within a project! It used HTML and CSS styling.

    <h4>About Me</h4>
  </div>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed the projects section! Now I would like tell you a little about myself. I have lived and experienced many different places. Along the way I was able to also have a wide array of different jobs. My favorite was probably building elevators in Switzerland! Currently, I weld custom Sailboat trailers! I have grown weary of the long term health effects associated with welding, and the unsustainability of prolonged manual labor, which led me to change my career path. I enrolled at <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> and have been enjoying it immensely! Here is a list of some other things I enjoy.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I have released, and continue to write, music. Mostly a little know genre called Drum n Bass.
      </li>
      <li>
        I quite enjoy all things physics and astronomy. I could talk for <strong>hours</strong> about the inner workings of the universe!
      </li>
      <li>
        Fatherhood has been an adjustment, to say the least. Everything I do now is in the service of my son, and future children!
      </li>
